- What does that mean?
- I am a soldier.

168
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:10,715
I was bred to receive orders.

169
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,301
Well, you're never gonna get any. Not ever.

170
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,678
I demand orders!

171
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,306
They're never gonna come. Your race is dead.

172
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,518
You all burnt. All of you.
Ten million ships on fire.

173
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,145
The entire Dalek race
wiped out, in one second.

00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:26,605
You lie!

175
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:27,774
I watched it happen.

176
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:29,149
I made it happen.

177
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,650
You destroyed us?

178
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,831
I had no choice.

179
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:48,128
And what of the Time Lords?

180
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,217
Dead.

181
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,220
They burnt with you.

182
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,770
The end of the Last Great Time War.

183
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,850
Everyone lost.

184
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:08,440
And the coward survived.

185
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,775

Uhh.

- A lump of metal?
- Yeah.

222
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,894
Yeah, but I think...

223
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:15,316
Well, I'm almost certain,
it's from the hull of a spacecraft.

224
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:21,029
The thing is, it's all true, everything the
United Nations tries to keep quiet.

225
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,991
Spacecraft, aliens, visitors to Earth.

226
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,411
They really exist.

227
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,662

Not in our lifetimes.

been inside of spaceships and things,

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,196

00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,077
Van Statten has agents all over the world,

245
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:10,205
looking for geniuses to recruit.

246
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,499
Oh, right, you're a genius.

247
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,000
Sorry, but, yeah.

248
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,600
I can't help it, I was born clever.

249
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:20,465
When I was eight,
I logged onto the US defence system.

250
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,133
Nearly caused World War Three.

251
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,551
What, and that's funny, is it?

252
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,386
You should've been there.
Just to see them running about.

253
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,888
Fantastic!

254
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,225
You sound like the Doctor.

255
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:33,436
- Are you and him...
- No, we're just friends.

Good.

00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,898
Why's that good?

258
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,399
Just is.

259
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,322
So, wouldn't you rather be downstairs?

260
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,366
You've got these bits of metal and stuff,

261
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:50,577
but Mr van Statten's got
a living creature down there.

262
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:54,239
Yeah. Well, I did ask,
but he keeps it to himself.

263
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,251
Although, if you're a genius,

264
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,587
it doesn't take long to patch
through on the comms system.

266

It doesn't do much, the alien.

267
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,932
It's weird, it's kind of useless.

268
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:14,269

- I don't know.
- Take me down there. Now.

272
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,495
The metal's just battle armour.

273
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:35,123
The real Dalek creature is inside.

274
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,707
- What does it look like?
- A nightmare.

275
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,751
It's a mutation.
The Dalek race were genetically engineered.

276
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,254
Every single emotion
was removed, except hate.

277
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:45,424
Genetically engineered? By whom?

278
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,051
By a genius, van Statten.

279
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,721
By a man who was
king of his own little world. You'd like him.

280
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,806
It's been on Earth for over 50 years.

281
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,183
Sold at private auction,
moving from one collection to another.

282
00:14:55,184 --> 00:14:56,519
Why would it be a threat now?

283
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,355
Because I'm here. How did it get to Earth?
Does anyone know?

284
00:14:59,355 --> 00:15:01,982
The records say it came
from the sky like a meteorite.

285
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,152
It fell to Earth on the Ascension Islands,

286
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,736
burnt in its crater for three days,

287
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,988
before anybody could get near it.

288
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:11,188
And all that time, it was screaming.
Must have gone insane.

289
00:15:12,952 --> 00:15:15,495
It must have fallen through time.
The only survivor.

00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:20,626

between my people and the Dalek race.

when I can sell a thousand palliatives?

A Dalek is honest.

born to do, for the survival of its species.

521
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,405
Rid the universe of your filth!

522
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:09,906
Why don't you just die?

523
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:15,913
You would make a good Dalek.

524
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:25,588
Seal the vaults.

525
00:31:33,807 --> 00:31:37,519
I can leech power off the ground
defences, feed it to the bulkheads.

This isn't the best time!

- DOCTOR: Where are you?
- Level 49.

532
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:54,452
You've got to keep moving.
The vault is being sealed off up at level 46.

00:31:54,453 --> 00:31:55,996
Can't you stop them closing?

534
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,204
I'm the one who's closing them.

535
00:31:57,205 --> 00:31:58,915
I can't wait, and I can't help you.

536

Now for God's sake, run!

537
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:10,844
Done it! We've got power to the bulkheads.

GODDARD: The Dalek's
right behind them.

539
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,097
We're nearly there! Give us two seconds!

540
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:16,516
Doctor, I can't sustain the power.

541
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,184
The whole system is failing.

542
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:21,155
Doctor, you've got to close the bulkheads.

00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,280

See you, then, Doctor.

552
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,758
It wasn't your fault.

553
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,729
Remember that, okay? It wasn't your fault.

(ELECTRICAL PULSE)

00:33:58,243 --> 00:33:59,493

I'm sorry.

She was only here
because of me, and you're sorry?

I could have killed
that Dalek in its cell, but you stopped me.

563
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,507
It was the prize of my collection!

564
00:34:12,507 --> 00:34:15,248
Your collection? Well, was it worth it?

00:34:15,594 --> 00:34:18,505
Worth all those men's deaths? Worth Rose?

Let me tell you something, van Statten.

567
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,934
Mankind goes into space to explore.

568
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:24,393
To be part of something greater...

569
00:34:24,394 --> 00:34:27,438
Exactly! I wanted to touch the stars.

570
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,233
You just want to drag the stars
down and stick them underground,

571
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:32,652
underneath tons of sand and dirt,

572
00:34:32,652 --> 00:34:34,653
and label them.

573
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:38,364
You're about
as far from the stars as you can get.

574
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,289
And you took her down with you.

575
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:48,541
She was 19 years old.

576
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,721
Go on then, kill me.

00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:12,900
They're all dead because of you!

581
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:16,403
They are dead because of us!

You were quick on your feet,
leaving Rose behind.

601

I killed her once.

602
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,811
I can't do it again.

You bleeding heart, what the hell do we do?

605
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:54,126
- Kill it when it gets here.
- All the guns are useless,

606
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,503
and the alien weapons are in the vault.

607

Only the catalogued ones.

Mr van Statten tends to dispose of his staff

611
00:37:11,353 --> 00:37:13,103
and when he does, he wipes their memory.

I needed to fight my way out one day.

- I could do!

throw your A Levels at 'em?

Oh, yes!

Lock and load!

618
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,543
I'm begging you, don't kill them.
You didn't kill me.

619
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,005
But why not?

620
00:37:39,005 --> 00:37:41,505
Why are you alive?

621
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:44,052
My function is to kill.

00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:04,028
You tortured me.

627
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:05,949
Why?

628
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:09,702
I wanted to help you, I just... I don't know,
I was trying to help.

629
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,621
I thought if we could
get through to you, if we could mend you...

630
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,373
I wanted you better. I'm sorry.

631
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,965
I'm so sorry. I swear, I just wanted you to talk!

632
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:20,797
Then hear me talk now.

633
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,467

Don't do it! Don't kill him!

You don't have to do this anymore.

There must be something else,
not just killing. What else is there?

No! 'Cause I won't let you do this.

It's not the one pointing the gun at me.

649
00:40:32,554 --> 00:40:35,097
I've got to do this. I've got to end it.

650
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,898
The Daleks destroyed my home, my people.

651
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:39,811
I've got nothing left.

652
00:40:39,811 --> 00:40:42,311
Look at it.

653
00:40:44,315 --> 00:40:46,815
What's it doing?

654
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:50,195
It's the sunlight. That's all it wants.

655
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,364
But it can't...

656
00:40:51,364 --> 00:40:56,074
It couldn't kill van Statten, it couldn't kill me.
It's changing.

657
00:40:56,286 --> 00:40:58,786
And what about you, Doctor?

00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,557

666
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,414
You're not even that.

667
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:46,208
Rose did more than regenerate you.

668
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,920
You've absorbed her DNA.

669
00:41:49,088 --> 00:41:50,965
You're mutating.

670
00:41:50,965 --> 00:41:53,927
Into what?

671
00:41:55,094 --> 00:41:57,594
Something new.

672

00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:03,809
Isn't that better?

674

676
00:42:10,902 --> 00:42:15,322
so many ideas.

677
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:19,786
So much darkness.

678
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:23,581
Rose. Give me orders.

679
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,961
Order me to die.

680
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,260
I can't do that.

681
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,760
This is not life.

682
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:41,722
This is sickness.

683
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,019
I shall not be like you!

684
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:49,396
Order my destruction!

00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,534
Do it.

Are you frightened, Rose Tyler?

00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,297
Yeah.

689
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,719
So am I.

Two hundred personnel dead,
and all because of you, sir.

693
00:44:03,806 --> 00:44:07,476
Take him away, wipe his memory
and leave him by the road someplace.

694
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,978
You can't do this to me!

695
00:44:08,978 --> 00:44:10,563
I am Henry van Statten!

696
00:44:10,563 --> 00:44:13,900
By tonight, Henry van Statten
will be a homeless, brainless junkie,

living on the streets
of San Diego, Seattle, Sacramento.

698
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:21,155
Some place beginning with "S."

00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,626
I'm the only one left.

702
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,128
I win. How about that?

703
00:44:36,005 --> 00:44:37,382
The Dalek survived.

704
00:44:37,382 --> 00:44:39,342
Maybe some of your people did, too.

705
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:40,760
I'd know.

706
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,012
In here.

707
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:45,306
Feels like there's no one.

708
00:44:45,306 --> 00:44:48,434
Well, then. Good thing
I'm not going anywhere.

709
00:44:48,434 --> 00:44:49,601
Yeah.

710
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,269
We'd better get out.

711
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:54,023
Van Statten's disappeared.
They're closing down the base.

712
00:44:54,023 --> 00:44:55,942
ADAM: Goddard says
they're gonna fill it full of cement,

713
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,150
like it never existed!

714
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,945
It's about time.

715
00:44:58,945 --> 00:45:00,195
I'll have to go back home.

716
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,322
Better hurry up, then.

717
00:45:01,322 --> 00:45:03,615
Next flight to Heathrow leaves at 1500 hours.

718
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:07,286
Adam was saying
that all his life, he wanted to see the stars.

719
00:45:07,286 --> 00:45:09,621
Tell him to go and stand outside, then.

720
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,125
He's all on his own, Doctor. And he did help.

721
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,543
He left you down there!

722
00:45:13,543 --> 00:45:14,668
So did you.

723
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,795
What are you talking about?
We've got to leave!

724
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,297
Plus, he's a bit pretty.

725
00:45:18,297 --> 00:45:20,797
I hadn't noticed.

726
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,592
On your own head.

727
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:25,679
What are you doing? She said cement.

728
00:45:25,972 --> 00:45:29,222
She wasn't joking, we're gonna get sealed in!

729
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,311
Doctor?

730
00:45:32,311 --> 00:45:35,222
What are you doing standing inside a box?

731
00:45:37,775 --> 00:45:40,275
Rose?

732
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,280
(WHOOSHING)

733
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:55,835
The fourth great and bountiful human empire.

734
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:58,335
Planet Earth at its height.

735
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,382
Kronkburger with cheese,
kronkburger with pajatos.

736
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,302
Something's wrong.

737
00:46:04,302 --> 00:46:06,094
My watch must be wrong.

738
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,346
That's what comes with showing off.

739
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,847
Your history's not as good
as you thought it was.

740
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,016
My history's perfect.

741
00:46:10,016 --> 00:46:11,349
Well, obviously not.

742
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,893
I can taste it.

743
00:46:12,894 --> 00:46:14,353
Engage safety.

744
00:46:14,353 --> 00:46:17,384
MAN: Someone down there
shouldn't be here.
weird man: oh yeah.
- man: shit.

745
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,360
WOMAN: Who are you?

746
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,153
I'm the editor.

747
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,405
What's happening?

748
00:46:24,405 --> 00:46:26,905
And spike.

749
00:46:29,327 --> 00:46:31,827
(WOMAN SCREAMING)


750
00:48:29,327 --> 00:48:31,827
ANAKIN: the key works!
(SIGHING) What to do (2nd line)
