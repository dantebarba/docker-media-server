00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:44,615
What about all these people
round the edge?

176
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:46,618
They've all got tiny little
chips in their head

177
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:50,705
connecting them to her,
and they transmit 600 channels.

178
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:55,309
Every single fact
in the Empire beams out of this place.

179
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:59,169
Now, that's what I call power.

180
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:02,751
COMPUTER: Analysis confirmed.
Security breach.

181
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:05,928
I knew it. Which one?

182
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:09,399
It's someone inside
that room. Which one?

183
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:14,351
Isolating breach.

184
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:17,897
Come on. Show me. Who is it?

185
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:23,278
ROSE: You all right?
ADAM: I can see her brain.

186
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,129
- Do you wanna get out?
- No, but this...

187
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:29,023
This technology, it's...
It's amazing.

188
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:31,702
This technology's wrong.

189
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:35,165
Trouble?

190
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,667
Oh, yeah.

That's it! Ho, ho, ho, yes!

193
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:46,094
She's the liar.
Intercept and scan.

194
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:50,096
Gotcha!

(GASPS)

196
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:58,648
Come off it, Suki,
I wasn't even halfway. What was that for?

197
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:01,149
Sorry.
It must've been a glitch.

198
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,158
Her information's
been tampered with.

199
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:07,782
There's a second biography
hidden underneath.

200

- (CREATURE GROWLING)
- Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

201
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,249
Yeah, her data was encrypted but there's no
way we could have found her sooner.

202
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,918
- (GROWLING)
- Yeah, sorry, I... Yeah, sorry, sir.

- Yeah, absolutely.

204

Oh, my God, make it me!

Come on, say my name,

Suki Macrae Cantrell.
Please proceed to Floor 500.

211
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:48,280
I don't believe it! Floor 500!

212
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:52,744
How the hell
did you manage that? I'm above you!

213
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,225
I don't know,
I just applied on the off chance.

214
00:11:56,456 --> 00:11:58,206
And they've said yes!

215
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:02,169
So not fair. I've been applying
to Floor 500 for three years.

216
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:04,504
What's Floor 500?

217
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:07,005
The walls are made of gold.

I'm gonna miss you.

219
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:14,182
- Floor 500. Thank you.
- I didn't do anything.

220
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:16,017
You're my lucky charm.

221
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:17,393
All right, I'll hug anyone.

225
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:25,525
Yeah, well,
she's closed it now.

226
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:28,027
Yeah, but...

227
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,114
It's everything.
It freaks me out.

228
00:12:32,784 --> 00:12:34,869
- And I just need to...

Ah, if I could just...
(SIGHS)

230

Cool down,
sort of acclimatise.

231

How do you mean?

232
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:46,213
Maybe I could just
go and sit on the observation deck.

233
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:48,048
Will that be all right?

234
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:52,427
Soak it in, you know.
Pretend I'm a citizen of the year 200,000.

235
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:54,681
Do you want me
to come with you?

236
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:57,182
No, no, you stick
with the Doctor.

237
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:02,562
You'd rather be with him.

238
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:08,945
It's gonna take a better man
than me to get between you two.

239
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:10,278
Anyway...

240
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,740
I'll be on the deck.

241
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,993
Here you go,
take the Tardis key.

242

You know, just in case
it gets a bit too much.

in there.

I've got to go, I can't keep them waiting.

246
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,260
I'm sorry.

Good riddance.

You're talking like you'll never see her again.
She's only going upstairs.

We won't. Once you go to Floor 500,
you never come back.

- Have you ever been up there?
- Can't.

You need a key for the lift
and you only get a key with promotion.

would you please confirm your name?

My name is

I was born 199'89,

268
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:21,739
in the Independent Republic
of Morocco.

and archaeology.

I'm not an expert or anything,
I just like digging.

Liar!

273
00:17:30,164 --> 00:17:32,833
I want to work for
Satellite Five because

274
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:35,334
my sister can't
afford university.

275
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:37,505

is really good...

shall we?

There's the truth.

to the present day,

give me the history

Oh, my God.

309
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:54,599
Look, they only give us 20 minutes
maintenance. Can't you give it a rest?

310
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:58,938
But you've never been to another
floor? Not even one floor down?

311
00:19:58,939 --> 00:20:00,689
I went to floor 16
when I first arrived.

312
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,317
That's medical, that's when
I got my head done. And then I...

313
00:20:03,317 --> 00:20:04,527
I came straight here.

314

Yeah, well, whatever it is,
don't involve me. I don't know anything.

- Don't you even ask?
- Why would I?

You're a journalist!

320
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,337
Why's all the crew human?

321
00:20:24,338 --> 00:20:25,839
What's that got
to do with anything?

322
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,092
There's no aliens on board.
Why?

323
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,969
I don't know.
No real reason.

324
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,819
- They're not banned or anything.
- Then where are they?

325
00:20:34,723 --> 00:20:37,559
I suppose Immigration's tightened up.
It's had to, what with all the threats.

326
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,811
What threats?

327
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:42,712
I don't know, all of them,
usual stuff.

328
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,777
And the price of space warp
doubled, so that kept the visitors away.

329
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,863
Oh, and the government
on Chavic Five collapsed,

330
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:51,423
so that lot stopped coming, you see?

331
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,741
Just lots of little reasons,
that's all.

332
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:57,538
Adding up to one, great big fact.
And you didn't even notice.

333
00:20:57,538 --> 00:20:59,914
Doctor, I think, if there
was any sort of conspiracy,

334
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:01,959
Satellite Five
would have seen it.

335
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,211
- We see everything.
- I can see better.

336
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:06,963
This society's the wrong shape,
even the technology.

- It's cutting edge!
- It's backwards.

338
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:10,134
There's a great big door
in your head.

339
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:12,886
- You should've chucked this out years ago!
- So what you think's going on?

340
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:15,138
It's not just this space station,
it's the whole attitude.

341
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,765
It's the way people think.

342
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:20,352
The Great and Bountiful Human Empire is
stunted. Something's holding it back.

343
00:21:20,353 --> 00:21:21,936
And how would you know?

344
00:21:21,938 --> 00:21:23,355
Trust me.

00:21:23,355 --> 00:21:25,816
Humanity's been
set back about 90 years.

346
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,807
When did Satellite Five
start broadcasting?

347
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:31,903
91 years ago.

348
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:38,746
Mum, Dad, keep this message,
okay?

349
00:21:38,913 --> 00:21:41,413
Whatever you do,
don't erase it.

350
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,208
Save it, you got that?

351
00:21:49,382 --> 00:21:52,800
The microprocessor became
redundant in the year 2019,

352
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:55,011
replaced by a system called,

353
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:58,223
SMT, that's Single Molecule
Transcription.

354
00:21:59,142 --> 00:22:01,434
No, no, no, no, no!
What are you doing?

355
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:05,105
Come back, come...
Why are you doing that?

356
00:22:07,483 --> 00:22:10,203
What's Floor 16?
What's down there?

357
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,638
Sorry, um...

358
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,829
Floor 16, that's, um...
What do you cover?

359
00:22:42,352 --> 00:22:44,519
Medical non-emergency.

360
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,480
Right, yeah, wrong floor.
I'm having technical difficulties.

361
00:22:47,481 --> 00:22:50,150
My screen keeps freezing,
locking me out.

362
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:54,760
No, that's medical. There must be
something wrong with your chip.

363
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:57,781
Yes!
Yeah, of course, yeah!

364
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:01,119
I haven't got one.

365
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:03,580
No wonder you can't
get a screen to work.

366
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,040
What are you, a...

367
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,419
Student?

368
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,920
Yes. Yeah, I'm, um...

369
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:13,798
I'm on a research project...

370
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:16,342
From the University of Mars.

371
00:23:17,804 --> 00:23:19,680
The Martian boondocks,
typical.

372
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:21,347
Yep!
(LAUGHS)

373
00:23:21,348 --> 00:23:23,808
Well, you still need chipping.

374
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:26,309
So, does that mean, like...

375
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,564
Brain surgery?

376
00:23:28,565 --> 00:23:30,648
That's an old-fashioned
phrase.

377
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,026
But it's the same thing, yes.

378
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:34,527
Oh!
Okay, never mind.

379
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:37,863
But if I get a chip,

380
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:40,701
that means I could use
any computer?

381
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:43,201
Absolutely.

382
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,122
You'll have to pay for it.

383
00:23:46,165 --> 00:23:47,625
They've stopped subsidising.

384
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,711
Oh, right, sorry.
Wasting your time.

385
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:53,546
Thanks.

386
00:23:55,174 --> 00:23:57,674
Hold on.

387
00:23:58,385 --> 00:24:00,846
Can I use this?

388
00:24:00,846 --> 00:24:03,182
That'll do nicely.

389
00:24:03,182 --> 00:24:05,913
It all comes down
to two basic types.

390
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,811
Type one, the head chip,

391
00:24:08,938 --> 00:24:12,548
inserted into the back
of the skull, 100 credits.

392
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:15,152
There's the chip.

393
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,945
Tiny, invisible, no scarring.

394
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:21,407
Type two is the full
info-spike.

395
00:24:21,534 --> 00:24:24,034
Oh, um, that's the...

396
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:27,872
- Thing.
- That's the one.

397
00:24:27,915 --> 00:24:30,375
It does cost 10,000.

398
00:24:30,376 --> 00:24:33,507
Oh, well I, um,
I couldn't afford it then.

399
00:24:33,587 --> 00:24:37,965
Not at all.
Turns out you've got unlimited credit.

400
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:43,430
No, but I...
Well, I couldn't have it done.

401
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:46,767
I mean, that's gotta hurt,
hasn't it?

402
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:50,059
Painless.
Contractual guarantee.

403
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:53,398
No, my, my mate's
waiting upstairs,

404
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,019
I can't have major surgery.
(LAUGHS)

405
00:24:56,568 --> 00:24:58,403
It takes ten minutes.

406
00:24:58,404 --> 00:25:01,954
That sort of money buys
a very fast pico-surgeon.

407
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:04,910
No, but I...

408
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:07,411
I couldn't though, no.

409
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,836
Type one, you can interface
with a simple computer.

410
00:25:13,836 --> 00:25:18,089
Type two,
you are the computer.

411
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:21,343
You can transmit any
piece of information

412
00:25:21,344 --> 00:25:23,095
from the archive
of Satellite Five

413
00:25:23,096 --> 00:25:27,307
which is just about the entire
history of the human race.

414
00:25:29,352 --> 00:25:31,852
Now...

415
00:25:33,147 --> 00:25:35,647
Which one's it going to be?

416
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:40,611
We're so gonna get in trouble.

417
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:45,659
You're not allowed to touch
the mainframe, we'll get told off.

418
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,326
Rose, tell her to button it.

419
00:25:47,327 --> 00:25:51,248
Youll just vandalise the place,
someone's gonna notice.

420
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:54,125
EDITOR: I don't understand.

421
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:56,086
We did a full security scan,

422
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:59,936
that man was there when
we found Suki Macrae Cantrell.

423
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:03,037
There were no
indications about him.

424
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:05,678
And yet here he is.

425
00:26:06,055 --> 00:26:08,694
Clearly acting
outside the parameters.

426
00:26:10,894 --> 00:26:12,853
Fascinating.

427
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:15,146
(CREATURE GROWLING)

428
00:26:15,147 --> 00:26:17,647
Yes, sir.

429
00:26:18,942 --> 00:26:21,319
Absolutely.

430
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,238
At once.

431
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:24,323
Check him.

432
00:26:24,324 --> 00:26:27,544
Double check him,
triple check him, quadruple!

433
00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:33,539
This is nothing to do with me,
I'm going back to work.

434
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,542
Go on then, see ya!
I can't just leave you, can I?

435
00:26:36,544 --> 00:26:40,631
If you wanna be useful, get them to turn
the heating down, it's boiling.

436
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,715
What's wrong with this place?
Can't they do something about it?

437
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:45,134
I don't know, we keep asking.
Something to do with the turbines.

438
00:26:45,135 --> 00:26:46,929
Something to do
with the turbines.

439
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,555
But I don't know.

440
00:26:48,556 --> 00:26:50,598
Exactly. I give up
on you, Cathica.

441
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:53,352
Now, Rose, look at Rose,
Rose is asking the right kind of questions.

442
00:26:53,353 --> 00:26:55,854
- Ah, thank you.
- Why is it so hot?

443
00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:57,439
One moment you're worried
about the Empire,

444
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,525
and the next minute,
it's the central heating.

445
00:26:59,526 --> 00:27:02,193
Oh, never underestimate plumbing.
Plumbing is very important.

446
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:04,694
(CRACKLES)

447
00:27:05,906 --> 00:27:08,406
COMPUTER:
Security scan complete.

448
00:27:09,117 --> 00:27:11,617
- Well, who is he?
- He is no one.

449
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,247
(LAUGHS)

450
00:27:13,248 --> 00:27:15,748
What does that mean?

451
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,584
He is no one.

452
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:20,085
What, you mean
he has a fake ID?

453
00:27:20,212 --> 00:27:22,712
He has no identification.

454
00:27:22,714 --> 00:27:27,051
But everyone's registered.
We have a census for the entire Empire!

455
00:27:27,053 --> 00:27:28,595
He is no one.

456
00:27:28,596 --> 00:27:30,430
What, he doesn't exist?

457
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:32,557
- Not anywhere?
- He is no one.

458
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:34,934
What about the blonde?

459
00:27:34,935 --> 00:27:37,270
- She is no one.
- Both of them?

460
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:39,189
(CHUCKLES)

461
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,526
Well, we all know what happens
to non-entities.

462
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:45,027
They get promoted.

463
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,864
Bring them up!

464
00:27:49,241 --> 00:27:53,744
Here we go, Satellite Five.
Pipes and plumbing. Look at the layout.

465
00:27:53,746 --> 00:27:55,830
CATHICA: This is ridiculous.

466
00:27:55,832 --> 00:27:57,915
You've got access to
the computer's core.

467
00:27:57,916 --> 00:28:01,545
You could look at the archive,
the news, the stock exchange...

468
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:05,746
- And you're looking at pipes?
- But there's something wrong.

469
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,384
- I suppose.
- Why, what is it?

470
00:28:08,803 --> 00:28:10,887
The ventilation system.

471
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:14,223
Cooling ducts, ice filters.
All working flat out.

472
00:28:14,224 --> 00:28:16,518
Channelling massive
amounts of heat down.

473
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,811
- All the way from the top.
- Floor 500.

474
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:22,023
Something up there
is generating tons and tons of heat.

475
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:25,527
Well, I don't know about you,
but I feel like I'm missing out on a party.

476
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:27,278
It's all going on upstairs.

477
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,489
- Fancy a trip?
- You can't, you need a key.

478
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,701
Keys are just codes,
and I've got the codes right here. Here we go.

479
00:28:33,702 --> 00:28:37,247
Override 215.9.

480
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:41,919
CATHICA: How come it's giving
you the code?

481
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,128
Someone up there likes me.

482
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,630
(LAUGHING)

483
00:28:51,386 --> 00:28:53,886
I told you it was painless.

484
00:28:54,473 --> 00:28:56,973
No scarring, you see?

485
00:28:57,727 --> 00:29:00,227
Perfect success.

486
00:29:00,896 --> 00:29:03,230
How do I activate it?

487
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:05,232
It's a personal choice.

488
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:06,984
Some people whistle.

489
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:10,645
I know one man who triggers it
with Oh, Danny Boy.

490
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,117
But you're set
on default for now.

491
00:29:15,118 --> 00:29:17,412
That's a click of the fingers.

492
00:29:17,413 --> 00:29:19,913
So, you mean I just...

493
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:23,791
Click.

494
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:29,090
- Come on, come with us.
- No way!

495
00:29:29,092 --> 00:29:31,718
- Bye!
- Well, don't mention my name.

496
00:29:32,386 --> 00:29:35,817
When you get in trouble,
just don't involve me.

497
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,101
That's her gone, Adam's given up,
looks like it's just you and me.

498
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:41,228
- Yeah.
- Good.

499
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:43,729
Yep.

500
00:29:44,106 --> 00:29:46,606
(BEEPING)

501
00:29:57,787 --> 00:30:00,287
Oh, my God! I'm gonna be sick!

502
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:03,039
(RETCHING)

503
00:30:09,464 --> 00:30:11,215
Special offer.

504
00:30:11,217 --> 00:30:14,135
We installed the vomit-o-matic
at the same time.

505
00:30:14,136 --> 00:30:16,805
Nano-termites have been placed
in the lining of your throat.

506
00:30:16,806 --> 00:30:19,306
In the event of sickness,

507
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,851
they freeze the waste.

508
00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:37,574
The walls are not made
of gold.

509
00:30:38,076 --> 00:30:40,494
You should go back downstairs.

510
00:30:40,496 --> 00:30:42,996
Tough.

511
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:02,641
I started without you.

512
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:04,603
This is fascinating.
(LAUGHS)

513
00:31:04,604 --> 00:31:07,521
Satellite Five contains
every piece of information

514
00:31:07,522 --> 00:31:10,483
within the Fourth Great
and Bountiful Human Empire.

515
00:31:10,484 --> 00:31:15,125
Birth certificates, shopping habits,
bank statements, but you two...

516
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:17,406
You don't exist.

517
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:19,576
(CHUCKLES)
There's not a trace.

518

00:41:45,994 --> 00:41:47,869

We're just gonna go.
I hate tidying up.

694
00:42:14,981 --> 00:42:16,733
Too many questions.
You'll manage.

695
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:18,818
You'll have to stay and explain it.
No one's gonna believe me.

696
00:42:18,818 --> 00:42:20,737
Well, they might start
believing a lot of things now.

697
00:42:20,737 --> 00:42:23,280
Human race should accelerate.
All back to normal.

698
00:42:23,282 --> 00:42:24,907
What about your friend?

699
00:42:24,907 --> 00:42:27,407
He's not my friend.

700
00:42:28,871 --> 00:42:30,704
Now, don't...

701
00:42:30,706 --> 00:42:33,206
I'm all right now.
Much better.

702
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:35,668
And I've got the key.
Look, it's...

703
00:42:35,668 --> 00:42:37,170
And, well...

704
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:40,300
It all worked out
for the best, didn't it?

705
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:46,085
You know, it's not actually my fault,
because you were in charge.

706
00:42:48,556 --> 00:42:50,474
It's my house. I'm home.

707
00:42:50,476 --> 00:42:52,976
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, my God, I'm home!

708
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:56,355
Blimey. I thought you
were gonna chuck me out of an airlock.

709
00:42:56,356 --> 00:42:58,648
Is there something else
you want to tell me?

710
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:01,150
No. Erm, what do you mean?

711
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:04,697
The archive of Satellite Five.

712
00:43:04,697 --> 00:43:08,668

could have changed the world.

That's it, then. See ya.

715
00:43:18,085 --> 00:43:20,128
- How do you mean, "See ya"?
- As in, goodbye.

716
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,338
What about me?

717
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,923
You can't just go.
I've got my head.

718
00:43:22,925 --> 00:43:24,717
I've got a chip type two.
My head opens.

719

- What, like this?

Don't!

721
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:30,972
Don't do what?

722
00:43:31,557 --> 00:43:33,893
Stop it!

723
00:43:33,893 --> 00:43:37,213
All right now, Doctor.
That's enough. Stop it.

724
00:43:39,023 --> 00:43:41,150
Thank you.

725
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:44,130
- Oi!
- (CHUCKLES) Sorry, I couldn't resist.

726
00:43:44,237 --> 00:43:46,280
The whole of history
could have changed because of you.

727
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,572
I just wanted to help.

728
00:43:47,574 --> 00:43:48,782
You were helping yourself.

729
00:43:48,784 --> 00:43:52,369
And I'm sorry.
And I've said I'm sorry, and I am, I really am.

730
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:53,788
But you can't just
leave me like this.

731
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:57,250
Yes, I can. 'Cause if you show that head to
anyone, they'll dissect you in seconds.

732
00:43:57,251 --> 00:43:59,751
You'll have to lead a very quiet life.
Keep out of trouble.

733
00:43:59,753 --> 00:44:02,253
Be average. Unseen. Good luck.

734
00:44:02,255 --> 00:44:04,673

- Geoff, is that you?
- It's me, Mum.

wait there a minute.

you were coming home!

ADAM'S MUM: Hold on,
Ill just take my coat off.

743
00:44:24,443 --> 00:44:25,987
I wish you'd told me
you were coming home.

got your favourite tea in.

Have you left
the back door open?

Blimey, there's a draft.

Oh, let me look at you.

Ah, six months.

00:44:44,297 --> 00:44:47,048
It's like I saw you yesterday.
Isn't it funny?

I've changed history.
