### Introduction ###
A simple [Plex Media Servers](https://www.plex.tv/downloads) plug-in that reads live streams (like [IPTV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPTV)) urls from a [m3u](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U) file and passes 'em to Plex in format understandable to Plex so it could try to play them.

In short, as title states, it lets You watch IPTV in Plex.

It also has a basic program guide, categories, custom logos and other goodies, **please read the [wiki](https://github.com/Cigaras/IPTV.bundle/wiki)** for information on how to set all up.

_Important note:_ Playback is handled by Plex itself, not the plug-in, and many streams are not playable by many Plex players, **please read the [wiki](https://github.com/Cigaras/IPTV.bundle/wiki)** for more information and possible [solutions](https://github.com/Cigaras/IPTV.bundle/wiki/Troubleshooting) if Your desired stream does not work.
